               <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center" style="font-size:18px; text-align:justify;">Mango is the fifth most important subtropical/tropical fruit crop worldwide with production centered in India and South East Asia. Due to the difficulty of specific pollination, mango breeding is still predominantly the selection of trees with superior fruit traits rather than hybrid production and evaluation. Recently, there has been a worldwide interest in mango genomics to produce tools for Marker Assisted Selection and trait association. There are five transcriptomes produced respectively in Israel, India, Mexico, Pakistan and the US. Our project "Mango Genome Database" is constructed upon the completion of the Pakistan mango leaf transcriptome and chloroplast genome sequencing with the aim of providing the scientific community with an accurate data and annotation of the mango genome sequence. Mango Genome Database contains annotated data including unigene of whole genome sequence of specie Mangifera indica L. (mango). The information contains predicted genes of the whole genome sequences and the unigenes are annotated in other species, KEGG pathway terms, providing a glimpse of the pathways and traits in which they are involved. The annotated sequence data can be browsed through Gene search page or queried using various categories in the search sites. The whole genome sequences can also be accessed and downloaded through Genome View. Some genetic informion will be available through our different sections in database. Mango Genome Database also provides online analysis tools such as Blast server for the Mango datasets, a sequence or gene search server and Genome view detection tools.

               <h2>Purpose</h2>
               <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center" style="font-size:18px; text-align:justify;">Fruit Science is one of the important sectors of agriculture. With the growing population, demand for fruits is gradually increasing, the most important challenge in many of the fruit species is the unavailability of well-defined availability of genetic study. There is no Database available for Mango genome so this particular platform will provide the data and information about Mangifera <em>indica</em> L. cultivars from different countries and allow the users to analyze their own data against our databases for many applications.
