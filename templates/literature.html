                Mango is known as the “The king of the fruits," because it is nutritionally rich with unique flavor, taste, heath promoting qualities and aroma making it superior among new functional foods, often labeled as “super fruits”. This exotic fruit belongs to the family of Anacardiaceae Botanically, a family that also includes numerous species of tropical fruiting trees in the flowering plants such as cashew, pistachio.

            <h2>Mango Aroma</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:18px;">
                Aroma is a complex mixture of a large number of volatile compounds, whose composition is specific to species and often to the variety of fruit. The most important aroma compounds include amino acid-derived compounds, lipid-derived compounds, phenolic derivatives, and mono- and sesquiterpenes.Mango (Mangifera indica L.) possesses a very attractive flavor characteristic. More than 270 aroma volatile compounds in different mango varieties have been identified in free form. Monoterpenes are the most important compounds contributing to mango flavor. Generally, terpenes are the major class of compounds in New World and Colombian mangoes whereas alcohols, ketones, and esters are mainly responsible for the characteristic aroma of Old World mangoes. <br/>            </p>
            <h3>Aroma Compounds</h3>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:18px;">
                Mango aroma is mainly formed by a complex mixture of compounds, but some authors consider terpenes, especially δ-3-carene, as the most important aroma constituents, due to the high percentage in the volatile fraction. The terpene hydrocarbons are considered to be important contributors to the flavour of Florida, Brazilian and Venezuelan mango varieties,Florida mango varieties, such as Keitt, Kent and Tommy Atkins, and 20 varieties of Cuban mangoes. In contrast, some varieties have considerable amounts of oxygenated volatile compounds, such as esters, furanones and lactones.
                <br/>The hydrocarbons (Z)- and (E)-â-ocimene have a warm,herbaceous, and floral odor, whereas the odor of δ-3-carene was sweet, reminiscent of refined limonene.  Myrcene and (Z)-â-ocimene were reported to be responsible for the green aroma of raw mangos.  The compound δ-3-carene was considered to be the major aroma-contributing component in some mangos , whereas the green aroma note typical of mango was correlated to monoterpene hydrocabons . Taking into account the strong and characteristic aromas of monoterpene hydrocarbons, the simple differences partly explain the known differences in flavor among the Cuban cultivars.Among the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, â-caryophyllene, R-humulene, and eremophilene were found to predominate in almost all Cuban cultivars. The first two compounds have also been found in significant quantities in other mangos. Eremophilene, the principal volatile compound ascribed to the African mango , was also found in some studied cultivars, whereas it could not be found in Brazilian fruits. The compound â-selinene, which was detected in considerable amount in Venezuelan fruit , in Willard and Parrot cultivars , and in African cultivars , was found in significant amount in only the Kent mango.The next class in importance after the terpene hydrocarbons was that of the esters, totaling 90 aliphatic, 16 aromatic, and 8 terpene esters found. Lactones, as intramolecular esters of 4- and 5-hydroxy acids, were also detected. 79 carbonyls were also identified.

            <h2>Mango Flavor</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:18px;">
Flavor volatiles are derived from an array of compounds including phytonutrients such as fatty acids, amino acids, carotenoids, phenols and terpenoids [10]. Fruit volatile compounds are mainly comprised of diverse classes of chemicals, including esters, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, and terpenoids. However, some sulfur compounds, such as S-methyl thiobutanoate, 3-(methylthio) propanal, 2-(methylthio) ethyl acetate, 3-(methylthio) ethyl propanoate, and 3-(methylthio) propyl acetate, also contribute to the flavor of fruit.Volatile terpenoid compounds, potentially derived from carotenoids, are important components of flavor and aroma in many fruits. Of particular interest are a group of terpenoid flavor volatile compounds generally present at relatively low levels but possessing strong effects on the overall human appreciation.             </p>

                Mango (Mangifera indica L.) possesses a very attractive flavor characteristic. More than 270 aroma volatile compounds in different mango varieties have been identified in free form . However, application of distillation extraction in combination with active odor value (aroma threshold) technologies exhibits that monoterpenes such as α-pinene, myrecene, α-phelladrene, σ-3-carene, p-cymene, limone and terpinolene, esters including ethyl-2-methyl propanaote, ethyl butanoate, as well as (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, (E)-2-nonenal, methyl benzoate, (E)-β-ionone, decanal, and 2,5-dimethyl-4-methoxy-3(2H)-furanone are the most important compounds contributing to mango flavor.                <br />The hydrocarbons (Z)- and (E)-â-ocimene have a warm,herbaceous, and floral odor, whereas the odor of δ-3-carene was sweet, reminiscent of refined limonene.
